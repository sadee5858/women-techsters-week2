            <!-- <dd>I believe that integrity is one of the most important ethics in the fashion world. While designs may be similar,
                 directly copying another designer's work is unethical and one of the biggest mistakes you can make.
                  I would rather produce something that consumers did not like than copy another person's work.
                 I take inspiration from others but have a unique designing process that helps me make my creation unique</dd> -->
                 <dd>Some of my favourite trends are from the 1920s, a time when you see clean designs and simple symmetry in clothes.
                     This usually reflects in my own designs, although I add some innovative elements and keep today's current trends in mind.
                     I believe that our fashion sense is a result of the legacy trends and our unique personalities.</dd>
